Returns a list of all installed images in the database. Each image is returned
as a L<Path::Class::File>.

=head2 get_image

    get_image( $image_name )

Returns the first image file (as a L<Path::Class::File>) from
L</get_installed_images> that has a filename that matches the string
C<$image_name>. 

=head2 install_package

    install_package($args, %opt)

A DB child can optionally implement this method in order to pass in arguments
for installing further images.

Keys in in C<%opt> may include:
